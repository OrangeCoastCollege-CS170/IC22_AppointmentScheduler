# IC22_AppointmentScheduler
Write a Java console program that allows students to schedule 1 hour appointments at either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 o'clock (pm only).  Declare an array that can hold exactly 6 Strings, one for each name of the person who will be scheduled for the appointment at a particular hour.  Write a loop that prompts the user to enter an integer value for the time they wish to schedule an appointment.  Within a try block, allow the user to enter a time (whole number) and a name.  If the time is free, put the name in the array at that timeslot.  If the time is not free, throw a TimeInUseException.  If the time is not valid, throw an InvalidTimeException.  Use a catch block for each different kind of exception.
